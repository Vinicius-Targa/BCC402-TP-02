// 10199 - Tourist Guide

/*
Those cameras are strategically distributed over the city, in locations that a
driver must pass through in order to go from one zone of the city to another. In
order words, if there are two city locations A and B such that to go from one to
another (A to B or B to A) a driver must pass through a location C, then C will
have a camera. For instance, suppose that we have 6 locations (A, B, C, D, E and
F) and that we have 7 routes (all of them bidirectonal) B-C, A-B, C-A, D-C, D-E,
E-F and F-C. There’s a camera on C because to go from A to E, for instance, you
must pass through C. In this configuration, there’s only one camera (on C). Your
task is to help Bruno (as he wants to be a musician and he doesn’t want to get
even close of computers) and write a program which will tell him where are all
the cameras, given the map of the city, so he can be your tourist guide and
avoid further fine
